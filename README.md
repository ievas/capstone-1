### About The Project

The app lets you learn and practice Spanish by translating words. It has gamification features with levels and badges, and has hints to help with more difficult words.

Currently the project is in testing mode. It has 3 levels and lets the user learn 15 words in a session. 


### Future Considerations

This app was inspired by Duo Lingo. 
It needs these basic features added to be a more functional language learning app:
* pronunciation,
* virtual keyboard,
* words grouped by their grammatical classes,
* difficulty-based levels.

### User Flow

1. User has to register or log in to start translating.
2. User is introduced to the level 1 words.
3. By clicking the start button they are taken to their first word to translate. They enter a guess.
4. A point is awarded for each correct guess.
5. Up to 15 points can be earned, at which point user can start over.
6. User can check their achievements by visiting the profile page.
